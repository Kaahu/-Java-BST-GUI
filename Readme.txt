________WELCOME!_______________________________________________________________

BSTGUI is a GUI program to teach the basic principles and operations of a binary
search tree. The user can add values to the tree, search for values, and delete
nodes. Each operation is explained by text on-screen, and additional information
about each operation can be displayed using the "Explain Insert", "Explain 
Delete", and "Explain Search" buttons.

The program makes use of Java's (admittedly awful) swing and awt libraries. It is
built upon a simple animated GUI program written as part of a university Java course.

The program consists of 3 main classes: BST.java, Node.Java, and ShapePanel.java.
BST defines the operations of the data structure which consists of Node objects,
which are displayed according to the ShapePanel class.

________HOW TO EXECUTE_________________________________________________________

BST.java
BSTGUI.java
